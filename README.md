### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the sales performance of a retail store to uncover key business insights. Using tools like Excel for data cleaning and data summarization, SQL Server for analysis, and Power BI for visualization, I explored various metrics such as top selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. The project demonstrates data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and actionable recommendations to drive strategic decision-making. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights these findings.
